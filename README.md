# Chrome Dino Game Implemented in Rust

Chrome's Dino game made with **Rust** and `ggez` crate.
`ggez` is used for loading resources and displaying graphics, while everything else (entity-component system, physics, collision, animation, asset management) is written from scratch.


## How to Run

If you have Windows, you can download the build from [itch.io](https://kapanion.itch.io/rust-dino-game).

You can also compile the source code yourself. For that, you must have `cargo` installed. Open the base directory and run the following command:
```
cargo run
```
